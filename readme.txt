TODO LIST

-General stuff
* Make a bean bag shotgun
* Add bleeding. Bleeding should happen on a random factor, assume that if a gun does 10 damage it has 10% chance of causing bleeding. Bleeding should not be able to kill you, because that was just annoying when it existed in Tacoscript.
* If bleeding and unconscious, your ragdoll should show bleeding effects
* Adding some additional melee weapons
* Postprocess effects for bleeding and for taking hits
* Disorientation/blur effects for taking melee hits.
* Adding new ways to control bleeding, and reviving people. For example, some right click option that will allow other players to do CPR on you and have a chance to revive you at very low health, or press down on your wounds for a chance to stop the bleeding
* Changing zipties so they actually work,
* Searching should be a right click option for people who are tied up. This should allow you to open their inventory and check for weapons, allowing you to take them.
* Limit the amount of weapons you can have on at the same time. Essentially limiting anything in slots 2 to 5 to just three weapons.
* Actually limiting ammo, making ammo actually save.
* Reduce default run, walk speed so it fits more with the game. Stamina should drain faster, recover slower.

-Hands
* Making hands be able to grab objects, and rotate them by pressing down E. This should all be physics based, so it looks more natural.
* Hands should be able to throw punches when unholstered, they shouldn't do much damage, so people would have to rely on numbers to actually take down somebody
* Holding R should make you able to block melee hits, halving their damage, but not reducing the knockdown chance.

-Melee weapons
* Adding essentially a melee weapon base would really speed up making new melee weapons.
* They should have a simple left click club/crush/slash attack, and a right click block.

-GUI
* Revamp the frame drawing scheme. The point is to make it more HL2 like, more gritty and techy, or grim.
* Redo the entire character selection menu, make it more "gritty", same with character creation. A certain degree of things can be removed from it, for example, we don't want people choosing their clothes by default.
* Add an option for creating a combine character.
* Add a GUI for combine city management, this should include ration spawning and depots, as well as broadcasting messages across the city.
* Change the main menu to fit the scheme
* Change the fonts, make them either Bebas Neue or a gritty alternative
* Change the intro to something entirely different, awesome.
* Redo the inventory. A classic, list based inventory would work better for HL2, as it would allow us to have item weights.
* Redo weapon selection, it should reflect the fact that there will be a limit on how many weapons you can have on.
* Redo ammo counter, make it more combat oriented instead of the minimalistic stuff we have now.
* Remove the current health, stamina bars to something more standard, like a normal, Health-Armor/Stamina/Conciousness display at either the right side of the screen or bottom
* Add a radio GUI more like Tacoscript, possibly add one for combine banter.


-Combine
* Add those scanner thingies that float around. Add the movement code for them, as well as animation tables for them.
* Combine loadouts should be slightly more complex.
* The Combine faction should have it's own GUI to manifest how it is different from all other factions.
* Add a more straightforward way to have admins and Combine leads to add ranks, and people to certain ranks. Promotion should be limited to combine leads and admins.
* Combines should have enhanced communication abilities, like being able to know where and when one of their units died. This would effectively make the combine more like the game, where they could keep a track on where you and ambush you based on when and where you killed one of them.
* Higher ranked Combine units should be limited to just the "Combine Stripped" player model.
* (Optional) Pilotable APC.
* Make them able to field out manhacks, which try to attack anybody but other Combine.

-Rebels
* Rebels should always be overwhelmed in every way, to force them on relying on guerrilla tactics.
* No rebel rank should have a weapon spawn. Then again, admins can add some, but we'll leave that up to them.
* Add crafting for melee weapons, basic armor, bandages from scrap. This is pretty straightforward to add, but it gives the Rebels an edge over regular citizens. Their guns should all come from dead Combine like in the game.
* Rebels should be able to craft their own "Ham radio" stations, which basically broadcast everything that is said around the ham radio station to a very limited set of frequencies.
* Purchasing licenses should be limited to strictly to things you can buy to craft, or first necessity items like drinks or food. Licenses should grant you the ability to buy items as -wholesale- not retail. This is to avoid people suddenly spawning the exact item they need at a certain time.
